  continue to use the more optimal 68020-40 target).

## AmiSSL 4.5 (29.3.2020)

  by https://curl.haxx.se/ca/
- Now includes separate 68020-40 and 68060 optimised versions.

  in a multi-application environment.

## AmiSSL 3.7 (2.4.2006)

- Fixed a problem in amisslmaster.library where init and cleanup routines
  might not get called a matching number of times.
- The expunge routine for amissl.library was cleaning up all currently hashed
  states, which is fine, but the pool from which these states were allocated
  was long gone at that time causing spectacular fireworks. Removed the
  cleanup from expunge routine and restored the one from close routine, but
  changed it to free only those states that belong to it (bug #2988).
- The 68k version now uses modified SAS/C libinit code which calls
  CacheClearE() instead of CacheClearU() to improve performance.

## AmiSSL 3.6 (4.3.2006)

- The close routine for amissl.library was cleaning up all currently hashed
  states, including those belonging to other openers of the library. This
  could lead to a crash when two programs were using AmiSSL (bug #2960).
