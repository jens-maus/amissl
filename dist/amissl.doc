   PURPOSE
	The amissl.library contains the public OpenSSL API functions. There are
	too many to list and document here, but you can find documentation on
	the OpenSSL API at https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man3.
	Instead, only the AmiSSL specific functions are documented here.

	Since AmiSSL v2, you must not open this library directly. In AmiSSL v5
	you should use use amisslmaster.library/OpenAmiSSLTags() instead.
	In AmiSSL v2/v3/v4, use amisslmaster.library/OpenAmiSSL() and then call
	InitAmiSSL() before you can start using OpenSSL functions. This is
	because multiple versions of AmiSSL can be installed at the same time
	with the libraries named of the form amissl_v<version>.library.

	Since AmiSSL v2, each opener gets their own unique baserel based
	AmiSSLBase. This can be shared between different subprocesses.
	Furthermore, this is encouraged since it allows the cache of server
	certificates to be used by all subprocesses that share the same
	AmiSSLBase resulting in	speed increase. Each subprocess MUST call
	InitAmiSSL() with appropriate arguments before using any other
	amissl.library calls and CleanupAmiSSL() before it exits.

   NAME
	CleanupAmiSSLA -- cleanup the AmiSSL library (V1)
	CleanupAmiSSL  -- varargs stub for CleanupAmiSSLA() (V1)

   SYNOPSIS
	error = CleanupAmiSSLA( tagList )

	LONG CleanupAmiSSLA( struct TagItem * )

	error = CleanupAmiSSL( tag, ... )

	LONG CleanupAmiSSL( Tag, ... );

   FUNCTION
	If using amisslmaster.library/OpenSSLTags() and the AmiSSL_InitAmiSSL
	tag to initialise AmiSSL, you must not use this function,
	as amisslmaster.library/CloseAmiSSL() will call it for you.

	However, for each process using AmiSSL, where you made a successful
	InitAmiSSLA() call, you	must pair it with a call to this function
	to cleanup and process related resources. Failure to do so can cause
	AmiSSL to crash. Once this function has been called, you must not use
	any OpenSSL functions.

   INPUTS
        tagList - pointer to an array of tags providing optional extra
            parameters, or NULL.

   TAGS

   RESULTS
	error - returns 0 on success or non-zero on failure.

amissl.library/InitAmiSSLA                            amissl.library/InitAmiSSLA

   NAME
	InitAmiSSLA -- initialise the AmiSSL library (V1)
	InitAmiSSL  -- varargs stub for InitAmiSSLA() (V1)

   SYNOPSIS
	error = InitAmiSSLA( tagList )

	LONG InitAmiSSLA( struct TagItem * )

	error = InitAmiSSL( tag, ... )

	LONG InitAmiSSL( Tag, ... );

   FUNCTION
	Usually, you will be using amisslmaster.library/OpenSSLTags() to
	initialise AmiSSL, so you should not need to use this function
	in simple applications. If you have decided delay the initialisation,
	this function must be called to initialise AmiSSL, once	opened,
	before you can use any of the available OpenSSL functions.

	Furthermore, if you would like to use AmiSSL in your application's
	subprocesses, it is recommended that you share the AmiSSL instance
	opened from your main process and have each process simply call
	InitAmiSSLA() instead of wasting resources and opening AmiSSL for
	every process.

   INPUTS
        tagList - pointer to an array of tags providing optional extra
	    parameters, or NULL.

   TAGS
	AmiSSL_GetAmiSSLBase - (struct Library **) Pointer to your
	    AmiSSLExtBase variable for AmigaOS 3.x. Because of the sheer
	    number of available public functions in OpenSSL, AmiSSL v5 spans
	    two library bases. If successful, this function will set this to
	    the opened library. DO NOT call CloseLibrary() on this as
	    CloseAmiSSL() takes care of it. Not needed in AmigaOS 4.x
	    applications. (V5)

	AmiSSL_SocketBase - (struct Library *) Pointer to the socket base. If
	    the caller doesn't need any networking functionality, or if using
	    AmiSSL_ISocket / AmiSSL_ISocketPtr for AmigaOS 4.x, this can be
	    omitted. (defaults to NULL). (V1)

	AmiSSL_ISocket - (struct SocketIFace *) Pointer to the socket library
	    interface for AmigaOS 4.x. If the caller doesn't need any
	    networking functionality, this can be omitted, likewise if
	    AmiSSL_ISocketPtr or AmiSSL_SocketBase has been specified
	    instead. (V3)

	AmiSSL_ISocketPtr - (struct SocketIFace **) Pointer to your ISocket
	    variable for AmigaOS 4.x. If the caller doesn't need networking
	    functionality, this can be omitted, likewise if AmiSSL_ISocket or
	    AmiSSL_SocketBase has been specified instead. This generally
	    doesn't need to be used, but may be useful if you need to open
	    ISocket after initiliasing AmiSSL. (V3)

	AmiSSL_ErrNoPtr - (int *)Pointer to the errno variable to set when
	    some of the C or socket library functions called by AmiSSL return
	    an error. You should always specify this tag or errno error
	    detection in your program will not work reliably. AmiSSL will
	    always instruct the network library to use a certain errno
	    pointer (ie. it will specify SBTM_SETVAL(SBTC_ERRNOLONGPTR) in
	    SocketBaseTags() for bsdsocket.library and similarly for other
	    networking packages) possibly overriding the errno pointer you
	    specified to the networking library yourself. If AmiSSL_ErrNoPtr
	    is specified, AmiSSL will use it for SBTM_SETVAL(SBTC_ERRNOLONGPTR)
	    or equivalent calls, otherwise it will use an internal errno
	    pointer and thus errno changes will not be propagated to your
	    application. (V2)

	AmiSSL_SocketBaseBrand - (LONG) useful only if you are using
	    MultiTCP linker library by Stefan Burstroem, you can ignore it
	    otherwise. (defaults to TCPIP_AmiTCP) (V2)

	AmiSSL_MLinkLock - useful only if you are using MultiTCP linker
	    library by Stefan Burstroem, you can ignore it otherwise. (V2)

	AmiSSL_Version - OBSOLETE - Used for AmiSSL v1 only
	AmiSSL_Revision - OBSOLETE - Used for AmiSSL v1 only
	AmiSSL_Version_Override - OBSOLETE - Used for AmiSSL v1 only
	AmiSSL_TCPStack - OBSOLETE - Used for AmiSSL v2 only
	AmiSSL_SSLVersionApp - OBSOLETE - Used for AmiSSL v2/v3 only

   RESULTS
	error - returns 0 on success or non-zero on failure.
