Short:        OpenSSL as an Amiga shared library
Author:       AmiSSL Open Source Team
Uploader:     Oliver Roberts <oliver@futaura.co.uk>
Type:         util/libs
Version:      4.9
Replaces:     util/libs/AmiSSL-*
Requires:     AmigaOS 4.0/PPC, AmigaOS 3.0+/68020+
Architecture: ppc-amigaos >= 4.0.5; m68k-amigaos >= 3.0
URL:          https://github.com/jens-maus/amissl

This is version 4.9 of the open-source based AmiSSL library for Amiga based
operating systems. Version 4.x is a new major release which comes with full
compatibility to the OpenSSL 1.1.x line which includes important security
related fixes, TLSv1.3 and comes with new encryption ciphers which are
required nowadays to connect to modern SSL-based services (e.g.  HTTPS).

Backwards Compatibility:
-----------------------
All applications compiled to use most previous versions of AmiSSLv4 will
automatically use this latest version once installed. Unfortunately, due to
some errors that were made in AmiSSL 4.3, applications compiled to
specifically use AmiSSL 4.3 will need to be recompiled with the AmiSSL 4.4
SDK (or newer) in order for them to be able to use this latest version.
Due to fundamental changes in the API between the old AmiSSLv3 and new v4
versions and the large changes between the old OpenSSL 0.9.x and the new
OpenSSL 1.1.x line, applications have to be recompiled with the updated
AmiSSL SDK to take full advantage of the modernized OpenSSL 1.1.x API.
Besides that fundamental change, AmiSSLv4 can be installed on top of a
AmiSSLv3 installation while still ensuring that applications compiled for
AmiSSLv3 will continue to work properly.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
--------------
This release comes with binaries for the AmigaOS4/PPC and AmigaOS3/m68k
platform only.  Unfortunately, due to lack of motivated developers we couldn't
provide native binaries for the MorphOS/PPC or AROS (PPC, i386, x86_64)
platform in time. If you are, however, interested in seeing AmiSSL v4 being
ported for these other Amiga-based platforms, please try to find motivated and
talented developers who could join our team as proper maintainers for these
alternative platforms. In addition, if you are a MorphOS or AROS developer
yourself, feel free to send proper pull requests to see your platform
supported in one of the next releases or please consider joining our team.

General
-------
AmiSSL is a shared library package, port of OpenSSL which is "an open source
project that provides a robust, commercial-grade, and full-featured toolkit
for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
protocols. It is also a general-purpose cryptography library."

AmiSSL contains three major components: the libraries, the certificate files
and a port of the OpenSSL tool.

Libraries
---------
The main library is "amisslmaster.library" which acts as a proxy which opens
the appropriate AmiSSL library (with compatibility to a certain OpenSSL
version) for the programs using AmiSSL. It is possible to have different
AmiSSL versions installed at the same time since amisslmaster.library will
make sure that the correct libraries are opened.  However, since a certain
version of amisslmaster.library cannot know about the future releases of
AmiSSL, it is important that the latest version of amisslmaster.library is
always installed.

The amisslmaster.library was introduced with AmiSSL v2, but since none of
AmiSSL v1 file names collide with later AmiSSL releases, they can coexist on
the same system with the later versions.

The rest of the libraries are found inside the AmiSSL directory (assigned to
AMISSL:Libs/AmiSSL). With the exception of AmiSSL v1 libraries there, none of
them should be opened directly, but through amisslmaster.library. The
technical details on this can be found in AmiSSL SDK documentation (see
https://github.com/jens-maus/amissl/blob/master/dist/README-SDK).

The previous versions of libraries in AmiSSL directory should be kept when a
new version of AmiSSL is released since they may still be used. For example,
IBrowse v2.3 uses AmiSSLv2 libraries through amisslmaster.library.  These
libraries are named "AmiSSL:Libs/AmiSSL/amissl_v2.library",
"AmiSSL:Libs/AmiSSL/blowfish_v2.library", etc. and are based on OpenSSL
0.9.6g. The first release of AmiSSLv3 is based on OpenSSL 0.9.7g, latest
available at the time. It includes "AmiSSL:Libs/AmiSSL/amissl_v097g.library"
(all other libraries like blowfish, cast etc are now included in it and the
name reflects the OpenSSL version number). Since OpenSSL 0.9.6g and 0.9.7g
have incompatible API's and public structures, when IBrowse v2.3 tries to open
AmiSSL through amisslmaster.library v3, amisslmaster.library will honor its
request and open AmiSSLv2 libraries even though AmiSSLv3 library is available.
The same applies to AmiSSLv4, the successor of AmiSSLv3.

Another example: suppose that a program is compiled for OpenSSL 0.9.7g API.
When it asks amisslmaster.library to open AmiSSL with that API,
amisslmaster.library will open "AmiSSL:Libs/AmiSSL/amissl_097g.library". If a
bugfix version of OpenSSL 0.9.7g called 0.9.7h with compatible API is
released, AmiSSL could be updated to include
"AmiSSL:Libs/AmiSSL/amissl_097h.library". The amisslmaster.library would then
open "amissl_097h.library" on behalf of the program even though it was
compiled for and asked for version 0.9.7g. The program would thus benefit from
the fixed version without having to be recompiled.

Certificates
------------
AmiSSL includes root certificate files which are installed into "AmiSSL:Certs"
directory (Note: the AmiSSL: assign must exist - it is usually added to
S:User-Startup by the install script).

Each AmiSSL version comes with a full set of root certificates and has those
that have expired removed. If you had some earlier versions of AmiSSL
installed, it is suggested that the old AmiSSL:Certs directory is replaced
with the certs directory from the latest AmiSSL archive (The installer script
should usually take care of that). Please note that it is not suggested to
manually add own certificates to "AmiSSL:Certs". You should rather add and
maintain them in "AmiSSL:UserCerts" so that no future AmiSSL release will
delete your own certificates. In addition, please note that usually
applications providing SSL/TLS functionality should provide you a way to
install your own certificates in this directory path. 

The OpenSSL command-line tool
-----------------------------
A port of the OpenSSL command-line tool is also included and usually installed
to AMISSL: during installatiopn. It is a "command line tool for using the
various cryptography functions of OpenSSL's crypto library from the shell".
The documentation for the OpenSSL tool is included in the archive and can also
be reviewed online: https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/apps/openssl.html
